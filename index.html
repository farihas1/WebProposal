      <h3>Home page</h3>

      <P> For the navigation bar, I decided to take off the search element as the use for it didn't seem useful or relevant to the purpose of the website, which is to make a streamlined process to donate. As for the navigation, I reduced one extra step that user would have to take if I originally included the hamburger icon. I created links to the original Youth Projects website, more information about the covid-19 response and also a link to the about us page. I also forgot to include a footer in my original mockups, so I made sure to create one this time that included the links for all of the Youth Project's social medias</P><br>

      <h3>Donation</h3>

      <p>For the donation page, I cut off the option to choose between two options because I realised I would go over the page limit. Additionally, I changed the button design because the original ones felt really plain and to follow the design of the buttons. creating some repetition in my website. For the custom donation, I created a required form so that users will not be able to press the submit button unless they submit a specified amount</p>

      <h3>About and Payment</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="final/about and payment.jpg"/>
      </figure>

      <p>I combined both the about you and payment page so that users would not have to switch between another window for payment. Also, the page felt quite empty when I inserted the about you and payment on different pages, putting together utilised the wide space of a desktop screen. The forms all remained the same as the layout fit the corresponding information e.g. the credit card details with your card. Buttons are following the same design as the others but in this case it creates an emphasis from the rest of the page. </p>

      <P> As for the final page before submitting your donation, I added a button to go back to the previous page in case users want to be able to change their information if they typed it incorrectly </P>
