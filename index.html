			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p> Youth project is an independent charity that provides support to young people who are experiencing homelessness, unemployment, disadvantage, alcohol and other drug issues. They also aid young people in learning and gaining employment, opening up pathways and breaking the cycle of disadvantage. </p>

      <p>Youth Projects 2020 impact report details that they have been rapidly adjusting to the new health crisis of covid-19, stating that they are the "last outpost" as more people are continuing to relay on their service to provide them basic needs such as medical supplies, food and isolation. </p>

     

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <p>Youth Projects as a non-profit organisation has been able to support more than 200 people who are homeless and provided them 'crisis accommodation' while also giving covid-19 testing and giving out food packs.</p>

      <p> Their current donation service are not concisely put together, having 4 different ways to donate to the organisation. My main goal is to make a centralised website where people only need to visit one place where they can chose how to help. </p>

        <figcaption> First I experimented with the navigation bar arrangment. I found that the simple navigation icon freed up more space on the web page. </figcaption>

      <figures>
			<img src="sketches/donate.jpg">
      <figcaption>For the donation page, I was originally intending to showcase a bar chart showing the progress of the their donation goal. However, I decided to cut that out as I only wanted users to take minimal effort to  donate money.  </figcaption>
      </figures>

      <figures>
      <img src="sketches/donation.jpg">
      <figcaption>I adjusted the donation page so the landing page is only just showing the different ways the user can donate to Youth Projects. Like the donation page in the website, theres a set amount users can donate with a description on how the money is being used. The user can also input a personalised amount.

      <figures>
			<img src="sketches/pay.jpg">
       <figcaption> The about you and payment page was used to just input your details to start the process of your donation. I experimented with two different ways of showing forms with the way the boxes were stacked or aligned with each other. </figcaption>
      </figures>
      <br>

      <figures>
			<img src="sketches/confirm.jpg">
      <figcaption> The confirmation page was difficult to design as I wanted to show all the information that the user inputed without taking up the whole page. I went with two different ways, one showing the information aligned horizontally and the other with the information aligned vertically. I chose the first option to make use of the wide screen resolution on a computer, while the last page layout would be better suited on a phone. </figcaption>
